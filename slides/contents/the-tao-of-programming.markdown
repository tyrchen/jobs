    ## What is it about?

    * Principles
    * Paradigms
    * Methodology
    * Patterns


    ## What is it not about?
    * Programming Languages
    * Frameworks or Libraries
    * Coding techniques


    ## Principles
    * Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
    * Open/Closed
    * Separation of Concerns (SoC)
    * Inversion of Control (IoC)
    * Convention over Configuration (CoC)
    * Encapsulation
    * Indirection


    ## Don't Repeat Yourself!

    * Hardware session installation (SoS)
    * octeon_pthread_init()


    <section>

    ## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

    <br/>
    *Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.*


    Let's rewrite ``octeon_pthread_init()``:
    
    ```
    def octeon_pthread_init(configuration='/etc/flowd.conf'):
        f = open(configuration)
        conf = json.load(f)
        cores = conf['cores']
        for core in cores:
            callback = pthread_callbacks[core['callback']]
            id = core['id']
            stack_size = core['stack_size']
            stack = stack_create(stack_size)
            name = core['name']
            
            # pre hook
            pthread_pre_init(core)
            
            pthread_create(callback, id, name, stack, stack_size)
            
            # post hook - e.g. UTM initialization
            pthread_post_init(core)
    
    # here comes the file content
    {
        "cores": [
            {
                "name": "TX",
                "id": 1,
                "stack_size": 128000,
                "callback": "PTHREAD_CALLBACK_TX"
            }, {
                "name": "LBT",
                "id": 2,
                "stack_size": 256000,
                "callback": "PTHREAD_CALLBACK_LBT"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    *This is also an example of SoC*

    </section>


    ## Separation of Concerns (SoC)

    <br/>

    *separation of concerns is the process of breaking a computer program into distinct features that overlap in functionality as little as possible.*

    
    <section>

    ## Inversion of Control (IoC)
    
    <br/>
    *Don't call me, let us call you.*


    ## A small server framework
    
    ```
    %% server_framework.erl - the framework
    -module(server_framework).
    -export([start/2, rpc/2]).

    start(Name, Mod) ->
      register(Name, spawn(fun() -> loop(Name, Mod, Mod:init()) end)).

    rpc(Name, Request) ->
      Name ! {self(), Request},
      receive
        {Name, Response} -> Response
      end.

    loop(Name, Mod, State) ->
      receive
        {From, Request} ->
          {Response, State1} = Mod:handle(Request, State),
          From ! {Name, Response},
          loop(Name, Mod, State1)
      end.

    %% name_server.erl - the implementation
    -module(name_server).
    -export([init/0, add/2, whereis/1, handle/2]).
    -import(server_framework, [rpc/2]).

    add(Name, Place) -> rpc(name_server, {add, Name, Place}).
    whereis(Name)    -> rpc(name_server, {whereis, Name}).

    init() -> dict:new().

    handle({add, Name, Place}, Dict) -> {ok, dict:store(Name, Place, Dict)};
    handle({whereis, Name}, Dict) -> {dict:find(Name, Dict), Dict}.

    ```


    ## Stop and Think

    <br/>

    * Framework defines convention, we just follow it
    * Details (concurrent programming) are hide

    </section>


    <section>

    ## Convention over Configuration

    *Aka coding by convention - seeks to decrease the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining simplicity, but not necessarily losing flexibility.*


    __ruby on rails is the best known CoC__
    
    Other framworks, like django, drupal, Spring, etc. also greatly inspired by CoC...


    code from 

    <small>tyrchen/church/church/management/commands/import_user.py</small>

    ```
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    from __future__ import division, unicode_literals, print_function
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
    from django.core.management import BaseCommand
    import codecs
    import json
    import requests

    __author__ = 'tchen'

    DIRECTORY_API = 'http://api.jcnrd.us/directory/employees.json'

    class Command(BaseCommand):
        help = u'Import employee directory'

        def process_user(self, item):
            u, created = User.objects.get_or_create(username=item['uid'])
            if created:
                u.set_password('xxxxxxxx')

            u.email = item['email']
            first, last = item['preferred_name'].rsplit(' ', 1)
            u.first_name = first
            u.last_name = last
            u.save()
            print('User %s %s.' % (u.username, 'created' if created else 'updated'))

        def handle(self, *args, **options):
            page = 1
            while True:
                data = requests.get(DIRECTORY_API, params={'page': page}).json()
                if not data['items']:
                    break

                print('\nProcess page %s\n' % page)
                for item in data['items']:
                    self.process_user(item)

                page += 1
    ```

    You can run it: 

    ```
    $ ./manage.py import_user
    ```

    ## Summary - what to bring back
    <br/>
    *DRY, OCP, SoC, IoC, CoC, Encapsulation, Indirection...*


    ## Paradigms
    * Generic Programming (GP)
    * Meta Programming & DSL

    
    <section>

    ## Generic Programming (GP)
    
    <br/>

    *Decouple algorithm with data structure, generalize the data structure used by algorithm so that the algorithm could be reused broadly.*
    

    __What's your intuition on GP?__


    *Yes in C++ we have this weired thing called template, and a library called __STL__... *

    <br/>
    ```
    template <typename T>
    T max(T a, T b) {
        return (a > b) ? a : b;
    }
    ```


    __Well, what we're talking is more than that...__


    ### Basic coding tests
    1. Randomly pick up 10 numbers from an array, sum up the primes.
    2. Given company directory, find female engineers then raise their salary by 10%.
    3. In CLI if user input a keyword which doesn't exist, print error message.


    __How do you abstract the algorithm?__


    ```
    // C++
    template <typename Iterator, typename Filter, typename Action>
    void process(Iterator begin, Iterator end, Filter test, Action action) {
        for (; begin <= end; begin++) {
            if (test(*begin)) action(*begin);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ```
    # Python
    def process(l, test, action):
        def f(x):
            return action(x) if test(x) else None

        return filter(None, map(f, l))
    ```

    ```
    %% Erlang
    process(L, test, action) ->
        [action(X) || X <- L, test(X) =:= true].
    ```

    </section>


    <section>

    ## Meta Programming & DSL

    <br/>

    *a programmed system begins to program itself.*

    print client.statuses.user_timeline.get()
    print client.statuses.update.post(status=u'test plain weibo')
    print client.statuses.upload.post(status=u'test weibo with picture',
                                  pic=open('/Users/michael/test.png'))

    ## Functional Programming (FP)

    ```
    % Erlang
    qsort([]) -> [];
    qsort([Pivot|T]) ->
      qsort([X || X <- T, X < Pivot])
      ++ [Pivot] ++
      qsort([X || X <- T, X >= Pivot]).
    ```


    ## Summary - what to bring back
    
    <br/>

    * OOP - focus on data, then algorithm operated on data
    * AOP - focus on core logic, moving concerns out
    * FP  - no side effect, more abstracted, and elegant


    ## Patterns
    * Observer (Pub/Sub)
    * Chain of Responsibility
    * Strategy
    * ...


    ## Observer (Pub/Sub)

    <br/>
    *event notification, linux kernel notifier chain, etc.*


    ## Chain of Responsibility
    
    <br/>
    *jexec nexthop, flow vector processing are typical use cases.*


    ## Strategy

    <br/>
    *the strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.*
    
    *3DES/AES, etc.*


    ## In summary - Zen of Coding

    ```
    >>> import this
    ```
    
    ```
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.

    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.

    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.

    Readability counts.

    Special cases are not special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.

    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.

    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

    There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you are Dutch.

    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.

    If the implementation is hard to explain, it is a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let us do more of those!   
    ```
